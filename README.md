🐍 My Python Learning Journey
Hey there! 👋 I'm learning Python from scratch, and I wanted to share everything I'm picking up along the way. This repository is basically my personal learning diary where I document concepts, code examples, and projects as I progress through the language.
🎯 What's This All About?
I believe learning is better when shared. So instead of keeping my notes locked away, I'm putting them out here for anyone who might find them useful - whether you're learning alongside me or just curious about Python basics.
📚 What I'm Learning
I'm taking a structured approach to learning Python, covering everything from the absolute basics to more advanced concepts. Here's what my learning path looks like:
🔰 Fundamentals – Building the Base

First, I focused on understanding how Python actually works.

I learned about:

Variables and naming rules

Data types (numbers, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, None)

Mutable vs immutable data

Type checking and conversion

Operators and operator precedence

Basic math and calculations

Getting comfortable with data handling made everything else easier.

🔤 Strings & Numbers Practice

Then I spent time mastering strings and numbers because they are used everywhere.

I practice:

String indexing and slicing

String methods (upper, lower, split, join, replace, strip, etc.)

Formatting text

Arithmetic operations

Math module functions

I also build small programs like:

Calculator

Temperature converter

Interest calculator

🔀 Control Flow – Making Programs Think

Here I learned how to make programs take decisions.

Working with:

if / elif / else

Nested conditions

for loops and while loops

range()

break and continue

Logical operators

Now my programs are not just running — they are thinking and reacting.

📦 Data Structures – Organizing Data Properly

Understanding data structures really changed how I solve problems.

I practice:

Lists

Tuples

Sets

Dictionaries

Built-in methods

Slicing and iteration

Learning when to use which structure is a big part of my learning.

⚙️ Functions – Writing Cleaner Code

Functions helped me write better and reusable code.

I’m learning:

Defining and calling functions

Parameters and return values

Default arguments

*args and **kwargs

Lambda functions

Local vs global variables

Breaking big problems into small functions makes coding easier.

📁 File Handling – Real-World Tasks

This is where Python feels very practical.

I work with:

Reading and writing files

Working with folders and directories

CSV files

ZIP files

OS operations

Now I can automate many daily tasks using Python.

🛡️ Error Handling – Writing Safe Code

Since errors are normal, I’m learning how to handle them properly.

Using:

try-except

Multiple exceptions

finally blocks

So my programs don’t crash unexpectedly.

🎨 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This changed how I design programs.

I’m learning:

Classes and objects

Constructors

Instance & class variables

Inheritance

Encapsulation

Polymorphism

Method overriding & overloading

Abstract classes

Now I can structure bigger and cleaner applications.

🔧 Modules, Packages & Libraries

To expand Python’s power, I work with:

Built-in modules (math, os, sys, datetime, json, random, etc.)

Creating my own modules

Package structure

pip

Third-party libraries

I also practice visualization using matplotlib.

📊 Working with Data & Time

I’m also learning how to handle real data formats:

JSON read/write

Object ↔ JSON conversion

Date & time formatting

Time differences

Time zones
